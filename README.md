üì• Installation

This repository includes an automated setup script with options for easy installation. However, review the script before running to understand what it does‚Äîit backs up your existing configs and installs new ones.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning


The script moves your current ~/.config files (e.g., for Hyprland, Waybar, Kitty) to ~/.config_backup.
It installs fonts and themes to ~/.local/share/fonts.
Do not run if you have critical customizations without backing them up first.
The script is in development; test on a fresh install if possible. Options like "uninstall" may not be fully functional yet.
For issues, open a GitHub issue or contact via email.
This setup assumes Arch Linux with Hyprland installed.

Automatic Installation


Clone the repository to your home directory:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-dotfiles-repo.git ~/dotfiles


Navigate to the directory:
cd ~/dotfiles


Run the setup script:
bash setup.sh


Choose "full setup" for everything or "manual selection" to pick components (e.g., Waybar, Neovim).
GTK themes (like Catppuccin) can be set via tools like nwg-look.



Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

Install dependencies via your package manager (e.g., pacman on Arch).
Copy configs from this repo to ~/.config/ (backup first!).
Install fonts from the fonts/ directory to ~/.local/share/fonts and run fc-cache -fv.
Reload Hyprland with hyprctl reload.

üêõ Issues & Contributions

If you encounter bugs, check the script logs or open an issue on GitHub. Contributions are welcome‚Äîfork and submit a PR!
For now, the setup script may have minor issues; manual installation is recommended for advanced users.
